    <p class="text-gray-600 text-center mt-4">
        Given the existence as uttered forth in the public works of Puncher and
        Wattmann of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard
        quaquaquaqua outside time without extension who from the heights of
        divine apathia divine athambia divine aphasia loves us dearly with some
        exceptions for reasons unknown but time will tell and suffers like the
        divine Miranda with those who for reasons unknown but time will tell are
        plunged in torment plunged in fire whose fire flames if that continues and
        who can doubt it will fire the firmament that is to say blast hell to heaven
        so blue still and calm so calm with a calm which even though intermittent
        is better than nothing but not so fast and considering what is more that as a
        result of the labors left unfinished crowned by the Acacacacademy of
        Anthropopopometry of Essy-in-Possy of Testew and Cunard it is
        established beyond all doubt all other doubt than that which clings to the
        labors of men that as a result of the labors unfinished of Testew and
        Cunnard it is established as hereinafter but not so fast for reasons
        unknown that as a result of the public works of Puncher and Wattmann it
        is established beyond all doubt that in view of the labors of Fartov and
        Belcher left unfinished for reasons unknown of Testew and Cunard left
        unfinished it is established what many deny that man in Possy of Testew
        and Cunard that man in Essy that man in short that man in brief in spite of
        the strides of alimentation and defecation wastes and pines wastes and
        pines and concurrently simultaneously what is more for reasons unknown 
        in spite of the strides of physical culture the practice of sports such as
        tennis football running cycling swimming flying floating riding gliding
        conating camogie skating tennis of all kinds dying flying sports of all sorts
        autumn summer winter winter tennis of all kinds hockey of all sorts
        penicillin and succedanea in a word I resume flying gliding golf over nine
        and eighteen holes tennis of all sorts in a word for reasons unknown in
        Feckham Peckham Fulham Clapham namely concurrently simultaneously
        what is more for reasons unknown but time will tell fades away I resume
        Fulham Clapham in a word the dead loss per head since the death of
        Bishop Berkeley being to the tune of one inch four ounce per head
        approximately by and large more or less to the nearest decimal good
        measure round figures stark naked in the stockinged feet in Connemara in
        a word for reasons unknown no matter what matter the facts are there and
        considering what is more much more grave that in the light of the labors
        lost of Steinweg and Peterman it appears what is more much more grave
        that in the light the light the light of the labors lost of Steinweg and
        Peterman that in the plains in the mountains by the seas by the rivers
        running water running fire the air is the same and then the earth namely
        the air and then the earth in the great cold the great dark the air and the
        earth abode of stones in the great cold alas alas in the year of their Lord
        six hundred and something the air the earth the sea the earth abode of
        stones in the great deeps the great cold on sea on land and in the air I
        resume for reasons unknown in spite of the tennis the facts are there but
        time will tell I resume alas alas on on in short in fine on on abode of
        stones who can doubt it I resume but not so fast I resume the skull fading
        fading fading and concurrently simultaneously what is more for reasons
        unknown in spite of the tennis on on the beard the flames the tears the
        stones so blue so calm alas alas on on the skull the skull the skull the skull
        in Connemara in spite of the tennis the labors abandoned left unfinished
        graver still abode of stones in a word I resume alas alas abandoned
        unfinished the skull the skull in Connemara in spite of the tennis the skull
        alas the stones Cunard
