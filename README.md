# Personal Portfolio

This is a simple portfolio to showcase my projects.

### Tech stack
The portfolio is built using [Django 5](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Project data is stored in a [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database, and static files are served via an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket.

### Acknowledgments
I used Real Python's [portfolio tutorial](https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/) as a major reference, though I also deviate from it quite a bit.
