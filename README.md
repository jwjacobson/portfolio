# personal portfolio project

This is a simple portfolio to showcase my projects.

### Tech stack
My portfolio is built using [Django 5.1](https://www.djangoproject.com/). If you want to run it locally, you'll need [Python 3.12](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) or later.

### License
My portfolio is [free software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software), released under version 3.0 of the GPL. Everyone has the right to use, modify, and distribute this project subject to the [stipulations](https://github.com/jwjacobson/portfolio/blob/main/LICENSE) of that license.

### Acknowledgments
I am using Real Python's [portfolio tutorial](https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/) as a major reference, though I also deviate from it quite a bit.
